## Agile Testing & Deployment

- Configured **GitHub Actions** to automatically validate code and ensure smooth collaboration on every push and pull request.  
- Follows Agile-style practices by providing rapid feedback and preventing broken code from being merged.  
- Once changes are merged or pushed to the **main branch**, GitHub Actions automatically deploys the latest version to the production server.  
- This setup reduces manual steps, speeds up delivery, and keeps the production environment up to date with minimal effort.
